# DDoS-attacks-datasets
This project contains three datasets having different modern reflective DDoS attacks such as PortMap, NetBIOS, LDAP, MSSQL, UDP, UDP-Lag, SYN, NTP, DNS, and SNMP. These datasets are based on the DCIC-DDoS2019 dataset proposed by man Sharafaldin et al. (2019).

After the pre-processing of the DCIC-DDoS2019 dataset, we have created three different datasets, named Dataset_2_class, Dataset_7_class, and Dataset_13_class, for the use of the AI techniques to evaluate and analyze the performance of intrusion detection systems for the IoT networks.


Dataset_2_class  (Binary classification)

Dataset_7_class  (Multiclass classification)

Dataset_13_class  (Multiclass classification)

In addition, we have preprocessed the TON-IoT dataset of IoT and IIoT sensors that contains 7 files proposed by Alsaedi et al. (2020).
